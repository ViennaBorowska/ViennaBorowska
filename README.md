Hey there 👋, I'm Vienna B

I'm a graduate Junior Full-Stack Developer based in Manchester, UK.

* 🏢 I have graduated from a Full Stack JavaScript Developer course at the University of Manchester with an A+.

* 🔭 I'm currently working on strengthening & broadening my knowledge with continuation courses and solo projects such as; an Angular Task Tracker, Shopify Liquid themes, React artist webpage & a HTML/CSS/JS cheese-themed Wordle spoof.

* 🌱 My main strengths are the MERN stack technologies, especially front end design (React, CSS frameworks e.g MUI) and database configuration (Express, Apollo, MongoDB).

* 👍 Interests: Accesibility, aesthetics, media production, eliminating bias in Machine Learning, reading, music, wanderlusting.
